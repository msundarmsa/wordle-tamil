# Wordle-Tamil

## Description
சொல்லி/Wordle-Tamil is an online game that was inspired by the popular ["Wordle"](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) game originally developed by [Josh Wardle](https://twitter.com/powerlanguish). All of the design elements and gameplay have been mostly taken from the original game.

This repo has been forked from the [wordle-fr](https://github.com/LouanBen/wordle-fr) repo whose contributors I also thank for providing me with an easily deployable codebase which I then modified to suit tamil words.

## Where do the words come from?
